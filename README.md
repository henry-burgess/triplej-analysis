# Triple J Analysis ðŸŽ¸

Whether you agreed with the placing of tracks in the Hottest 100 or not, there is a neat opportunity to crunch the numbers and compare the most played artists and tracks on Triple J with the final outcome of a Hottest 100 for that year.

The ABC has a public API where a listing of all tracks played within a timeframe can be accessed, and we can use this to extract a list of all tracks played by Triple J during any timeframe. This is just a project to practice my R skills and to learn about Australia's listening habits.

Ideas:

- Move this analysis into a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application so that people can play around with the variables.
- Add more analyses looking at months, artists, play frequencies etc.

Credit to Tom for the idea.
